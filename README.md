# Anterix
Club ANTERiX is a group of undergraduate students from VIT Bhopal
University, founded in the year 2021. ANTERiX is VIT Bhopal’s first ever aviation club
which will be dealing with the field of aviation and space technology.
VIT Bhopal believes that this club has potential to drive the student’s passion for their
field of interest and provide them the right knowledge. We help students from each and
every branch to dive deep into the subject whether it may be coding, electronics,
aerodynamics and any other mechanical work.
